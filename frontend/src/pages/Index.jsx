                        This is a prototype for the project codenamed "App for reading material" developed by Pedro Vidal and Nicol√°s Cevallos.
                        The app allows users to create student/teacher accounts to create or join courses in which reading material can be seen,
                        and tests based on this material can be taken with a grading system.
